    </ul>
    <h2><b>Steps:</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Put the onions and ginger on a baking sheet and roast
             for 30 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Fill a large stockpot with the water and bring to a boil. 
            Add the roasted vegetables and the chicken bones, 
            quartered chicken, salt, and sugar and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to moderate and 
            simmer until the chicken is cooked, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, transfer the quartered chicken to a plate and let cool slightly. 
            Remove the meat from the bones and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Return the skin and bones to the stockpot 
            and simmer for 2 hours longer.</li>
        <li>Strain the chicken broth into a large soup pot and cook over 
            high heat until reduced to 12 cups, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the fish sauce.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl of warm water, 
            soak the noodles until pliable, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Drain the noodles, then add them to the saucepan and boil over high heat until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well. Transfer 
            the noodles to 6 large bowls 
            and sprinkle with the scallion.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved chicken to the broth and simmer until heated through. 
            Ladle the broth and chicken over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Serve with the bean sprouts, basil, lime wedges, 
            jalapeños, chile-garlic sauce, and hoisin sauce.</li>
